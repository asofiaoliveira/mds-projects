*Taken from the report's introduction*

As part of the courseâ€™s practical work, we were asked to implement an algorithm
related to Bayesian Networks (BN), more specifically, a variable elimination
(VE) algorithm to perform inference in any BN. Inference in BNs is important
as it is analogue to the "prediction" in other ML methods, i.e., with inference in
BNs we are able to determine the probability of some event happening / some
hypothesis being true in a given BN.

Note that we do not train any BN since that is not the goal of this project.
We only produce a method that is able to make inferences on pre-trained BNs.

In the associated reported, we outline the code structure and how the user should
proceed in the execution. We follow with an explanation of the VE algorithm
and what was needed for its full implementation. Next, we compare some running times and memory usage of the procedure. Finally, we give our concluding
remarks for this project and propose some improvements to this work.
