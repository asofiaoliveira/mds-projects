Novelty Detection - MINAS
---

This project consisted of the implementation of the MINAS algorithm from the article by de Faria et al. [[1]](#1).

To run the code, you simply have to run the preproc.py file.
Some notes:
- You can choose how many instances you want to include in the stream
- you can choose how often to update the graph
- if you run in the terminal, you must comment line 8 of preproc.py

This project was developed by myself and Fábio Pereira.
